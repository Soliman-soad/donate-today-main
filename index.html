            A large number of the people of Bangladesh will spend tonight
            hungry, not knowing where their next meal may come from. Despite
            significant progress by efforts to reduce poverty in the area, the
            price of food is almost unaffordable to most, who do not earn enough
            due to rampant unemployment to provide for their families.

          There are almost 40 million people suffering people in Bangladesh, one
          quarter of the people of this densely populated country, who remain
          food insecure, lacking reliable access to enough food to get by, not
          knowing where their next meal may come from. These starving people
          suffer each day and night in this food crisis, with over 5 million
          children suffering severe complications.
